Source Sentinel, aims to analyse these metrics directly from code repositories, providing teams with actionable insights to improve their codebase.
The project is a local system based project and will only run after making changes to the code as most of the information is uploaded through path in my computer and this path needs to be changed for each and every user.
Packages like Pylint, Flask, Flask-CORS need to be installed in your python environment to run the code as intended.
The git page that is being analysed should also be a python project as the tool only works for python files, and you need to have all required packages to run the git project installed in your python environment to get the best results.
